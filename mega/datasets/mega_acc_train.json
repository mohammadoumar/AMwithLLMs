However I strongly believe that <AC1> they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values </AC1> .Firstly , <AC2> maintaining one \u2019 s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments </AC2> . <AC3> Take Australia for example , immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues </AC3> . <AC4> Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows , learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values </AC4> . <AC5> These feedbacks , in turn , help raise one \u2019 s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more </AC5> . Thus this makes it clear that <AC6> sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential </AC6> .Secondly , <AC7> it is crucial to keep one \u2019 s identity </AC7> for <AC8> they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin </AC8> . For instance , <AC9> children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends </AC9> . <AC10> In this new environment , parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home </AC10> . <AC11> Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated , in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism </AC11> . Hence , it is clear that <AC12> keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important </AC12> .To conclude , although <AC13> there are opposing ideas of neglecting one \u2019 s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures </AC13> . As far as I am concerned , <AC14> sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society </AC14> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Therefore <AC5> tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country </AC5> .Secondly , <AC6> through tourism industry , many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected </AC6> . For instance , <AC7> in Vietnam , many cultural costumes and natural scenes , namely \u2018 Trong Dong \u2019 drum performance and \u2018 Ha Long \u2019 bay , are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry </AC7> . <AC8> Without this support and profit from tourism , many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works </AC8> . Thus , <AC9> tourism has survived many non - tangible cultural values and beauty scenes </AC9> .To conclude , as far as I am concerned , <AC10> international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries </AC10> .

Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy . It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that <AC1> governments spend more money on buses , trains , and subways investment </AC1> . <AC2> Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society </AC2> therefore <AC3> they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air </AC3> .

In regard to the development of the country , some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities , while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment . In this essay , I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool - proof decision .To begin with , those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons .

In this regard <AC4> it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs , even can be a sheer time - consuming </AC4> .However , on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition , saying that <AC5> universities provide not only skills for careers , but also academic knowledge for the human race , such as bio science , politics , and medicine </AC5> . <AC6> These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world </AC6> . More importantly , <AC7> many researches in the ivory - tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society </AC7> . Another significant factor of universities is that <AC8> diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently </AC8> because <AC9> there are a number of chances through internships , deeper discussion , independent life , and exchange scholarships </AC9> .To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities ' education have reasonable justifications ; however , I agree with the latter view . Although <AC10> higher education does not guarantee young students ' success </AC10> , <AC11> the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges </AC11> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

From my point of view , <AC1> the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages , if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories </AC1> .First of all , <AC2> a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate </AC2> . <AC3> To manufacture goods , there must be the demand of laborers , from which the local residents can benefit </AC3> .

Therefore , <AC5> it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles </AC5> .Secondly , <AC6> an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion </AC6> . <AC7> Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while </AC7> . What is worse , <AC8> traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents </AC8> . Thus , <AC9> the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented </AC9> .In order to solve these problems , <AC10> alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively </AC10> . With regard to the former , <AC11> alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal </AC11> . For example , <AC12> rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries </AC12> . <AC13> This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee </AC13> . Since <AC14> bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses </AC14> , <AC15> it is a better form to protect environment than automobile </AC15> . As for the latter point , <AC16> the introduction of international laws can be also effective </AC16> . For instance , <AC17> there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only </AC17> . Thus , <AC18> these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution </AC18> .In summary , even though <AC19> some people claim the convenience of automobile </AC19> , I would state that <AC20> alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion </AC20> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

That is why governmental and non - governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries . It is true that <AC1> just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries </AC1> . In addition , <AC2> a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries </AC2> . However , I agree that <AC3> aiding poor countries has positive effects , overweighing its side - effects for the several reasons </AC3> .First of all , <AC4> poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer </AC4> . <AC5> To be out of poverty , it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light , electricity , load , highways , natural resources , technology and buildings for companies </AC5> . <AC6> Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business </AC6> . In actual , <AC7> republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960 ' s </AC7> . <AC8> Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties </AC8> .Secondly , <AC9> aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people </AC9> . <AC10> If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases , they would never take their abundance for granted </AC10> . <AC11> It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love , but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization </AC11> .Third , <AC12> the campaigns might include practical benefits </AC12> . <AC13> In globalized world , the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others </AC13> . <AC14> When America mortgage loan system went bad , several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated , even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt </AC14> .In conclusion , <AC15> there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid ; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people , keeping strong global economy </AC15> . I strongly believe that <AC16> being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers , and it will make the earth a better place to live </AC16> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

However , today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor .

However , although I respect the universities ' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause , I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university .<AC1> A university , in common sense , is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge </AC1> .

Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . However , I do think that <AC1> people are likely to spend less time in cooking food </AC1> . There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones .The first and foremost reason is that <AC2> with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time </AC2> . As a result , <AC3> people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years </AC3> . Actually , <AC4> in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework </AC4> . <AC5> And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology </AC5> . Thus , <AC6> it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future </AC6> .Another reason is that <AC7> most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants </AC7> because <AC8> they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves </AC8> . According to a recent survey , <AC9> 89 % of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on </AC9> . Thus , <AC10> they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal </AC10> . <AC11> Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study </AC11> .Some people may argue that <AC12> investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family </AC12> . To some extent , it is true . However , <AC13> as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality </AC13> . <AC14> Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed </AC14> , thus <AC15> health and life of eaters is assured </AC15> .

Consequently , <AC17> it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time </AC17> .To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint .

What is more , <AC8> women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration </AC8> .Admittedly , <AC9> such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate </AC9> or , under many circumstances , <AC10> women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives </AC10> .

In short , <AC5> without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists </AC5> .Furthermore , <AC6> it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation </AC6> . <AC7> Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries </AC7> . <AC8> Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country </AC8> .

They are used in schools , businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place . It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer , especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise . Nevertheless , some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored . Even so , I strongly believe that <AC1> CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace </AC1> .Firstly , <AC2> by having CCTV cameras at workplace , crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down </AC2> . This is because <AC3> when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced </AC3> . To illustrate this further , <AC4> in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight </AC4> . Not only that , <AC5> as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops </AC5> . Thus , it is clear that <AC6> CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized </AC6> .Furthermore , <AC7> at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers </AC7> . At times , <AC8> face - to - face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger </AC8> . Hence , <AC9> the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation </AC9> because <AC10> the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded </AC10> . In the event of an argument , <AC11> the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken </AC11> . In short , <AC12> these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers </AC12> .Looking from another perspective , the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy . <AC13> Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras </AC13> . However , <AC14> one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences </AC14> . Ergo , <AC15> opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime </AC15> .To conclude , <AC16> CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise </AC16> . <AC17> This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers </AC17> . Admittedly , <AC18> privacies are lost with the use of these cameras </AC18> . Nonetheless , <AC19> safety should be put first in order to be safe </AC19> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . In my personal point of view , <AC1> the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old </AC1> . I , for one , <AC2> strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age </AC2> due to several reasons that I shall discuss below .First and foremost , <AC3> if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates </AC3> . As a result , <AC4> most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for </AC4> . To illustrate this further , <AC5> a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available </AC5> . On top of that , <AC6> due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace </AC6> .Apart from that , <AC7> not all elderly workers are physically well </AC7> . <AC8> Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses </AC8> . To cite an example , <AC9> the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him </AC9> .

Therefore , <AC8> we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way </AC8> .Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that <AC9> it is easy to be deceived without face - to face communication </AC9> . For instance , <AC10> I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend , Eric </AC10> . <AC11> He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore </AC11> . <AC12> I just shocked and did not know what happened </AC12> . Finally , <AC13> I realized that his facebook account was stolen </AC13> . Hence , from this case , <AC14> we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face - to - face </AC14> .Admittedly , on the other hand , there might be some dissidents proclaiming that <AC15> communication by letters , email , or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple , which is also one of the most important parts in communication </AC15> . However , from my limited understanding , I just doubt the credibility of that saying . <AC16> It is conceivable that before we talk , it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words </AC16> . <AC17> Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication ; in contrast , it is usually detrimental to us </AC17> .Based on the reasons demonstrated above , <AC18> I prefer to express my opinion in person </AC18> because <AC19> the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite </AC19> . In other words , I think <AC20> the best way of communication is by means of face - to - face </AC20> . It is not to say , of course , that other points of view are completely without merit . Still , I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

In my view , I agree to that fact that <AC1> higher school students should be made aware of the money management </AC1> .The reason why I think <AC2> teenage students need to understand the money management basics </AC2> is , primarily <AC3> when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence </AC3> . For example , <AC4> while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses </AC4> .In addition , <AC5> if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized </AC5> .

If you did , it was probably at a zoo . Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept , so that people can look , learn and admire them . A lot of people think that zoos have no use , or provide no purpose .

Instead <AC6> if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal </AC6> . In my personal experience , <AC7> all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work , not my luck </AC7> . And <AC8> I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals </AC8> .Secondly , if you believe that hard work is the key to success , it would make you a visionary person . In other words , <AC9> those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination </AC9> . <AC10> They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal </AC10> . <AC11> If you believe in luck , you would be clueless about where you are heading </AC11> .

This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide . Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic . An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students . However , to my mind <AC1> students should be free not to attend classes </AC1> because <AC2> it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills </AC2> .Firstly , a liberal policy is very feasible . Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy . Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend . So an optional attendance saves time and money .Secondly , <AC3> some students might learn better at home on their own , for instance , by reading the textbook </AC3> . <AC4> This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic </AC4> . <AC5> By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching </AC5> . Thus <AC6> they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently </AC6> .In addition , <AC7> being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life </AC7> . <AC8> Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning </AC8> . <AC9> With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency </AC9> . <AC10> Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects , the better they perform in academic areas </AC10> .Finally , psychology knows two types of motivation . There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset . And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people . <AC11> Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well - being </AC11> . However , <AC12> in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims </AC12> . <AC13> By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves </AC13> . <AC14> These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time </AC14> .To conclude , <AC15> it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students </AC15> . <AC16> I hold this belief due to the improvement of students ' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards </AC16> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Also , <AC5> in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic </AC5> . <AC6> Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness </AC6> .

Personally , I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this .To begin with , the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that <AC1> cities often offer more well - paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas </AC1> . Obviously , <AC2> many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career </AC2> . Therefore <AC3> they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living </AC3> . For example , <AC4> if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work , he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time </AC4> .However , this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences . There can be no doubt that <AC5> the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities </AC5> . As a result , <AC6> cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation </AC6> . Additionally , <AC7> it might put strain on the environment </AC7> . <AC8> If there are more people in the cities , there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road , which causes air pollution </AC8> .In conclusion , <AC9> young people tend to study or work in urban areas </AC9> since <AC10> these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials </AC10> .

It is generally believed that , <AC4> the second - hand smoke , which comes from the smoker ' s mouth , puts an even greater threat on surrounding people ' s health than the smoker himself </AC4> . For example , <AC5> if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant , all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked </AC5> . This is because <AC6> some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person ' s respiratory system after he / she inhales it </AC6> . Therefore , <AC7> smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned </AC7> because <AC8> it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer ' s health </AC8> .Furthermore , even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second - hand smoke imposes on them , <AC9> the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite , or , in other words , spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience </AC9> . <AC10> The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted , thus affecting their mood in having their meals </AC10> . <AC11> This , on the other hand , can indirectly decrease the restaurants ' popularity </AC11> because <AC12> fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences </AC12> .Lastly , <AC13> smoking does no good to the smoker himself </AC13> . <AC14> Not only does it aggravate his health , making him more subject to respiratory diseases , but also it damages his public image and reputation </AC14> . <AC15> This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity </AC15> , because <AC16> most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior </AC16> .

Obviously , I do not agree with such kind of altitudes , the explanations I explored would be stated as following .First of all , <AC1> a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression </AC1> . <AC2> Through those impressions , a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible </AC2> . For example , <AC3> I worked in a new company , if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well , my new colleagues will accept me , even then I will be approved by the employers </AC3> . <AC4> In opposite situation if I am being rude , I can not get along well with each other </AC4> . Finally , <AC5> I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job </AC5> .Secondly , <AC6> people will get respect from politeness within each other </AC6> . <AC7> Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need </AC7> . <AC8> A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure </AC8> . <AC9> There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed </AC9> , because <AC10> from their behaviors , they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity </AC10> .Finally , <AC11> the society needs a civilized environment and orders </AC11> . And <AC12> a degree of social civilization depend on its people ' s qualities </AC12> . <AC13> In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings , our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners </AC13> . <AC14> Benefit from those effective measures , there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate </AC14> .All in all , I suppose that <AC15> people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world </AC15> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

For example in relationships . <AC3> Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances </AC3> because <AC4> they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle </AC4> . From my personal experience I recall that <AC5> my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city </AC5> . <AC6> I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away </AC6> . <AC7> Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today </AC7> . <AC8> Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship </AC8> .In addition , <AC9> cars increase the chance of employment </AC9> because <AC10> people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home </AC10> .

The following are reasons why .First , <AC2> environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments </AC2> . <AC3> All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one </AC3> . <AC4> Without Earth , whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain </AC4> because <AC5> we will all perish as she ' s gone </AC5> . <AC6> Just like a man that needs a healthy body , all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well </AC6> .Second , <AC7> the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues </AC7> . <AC8> Environmental problems are global rather than local , which means that no countries can be spared from these problems </AC8> . <AC9> Take global warming for example , when the temperature increases , the whole globe is affected , suffering the hotter weather together </AC9> . <AC10> The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region , but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator </AC10> , since <AC11> the rising sea water could drown them </AC11> . <AC12> Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality </AC12> because <AC13> all humans are simply entwined together by our only home - Earth </AC13> .Some people might argue that <AC14> economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside </AC14> . They may say that <AC15> if the economic is in a very bad situation , people would revolt instantly , while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away </AC15> . However , <AC16> the truth is that we ' ve been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now </AC16> . <AC17> It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately , usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages </AC17> .In conclusion , <AC18> environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence </AC18> . As mentioned in the second paragraph , how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy ? Similarly , how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by , ironically , by ourselves ?", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses , while some students don ' t feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams . These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations . In my opinion , I believe that <AC1> students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is </AC1> .First , <AC2> in terms of learning , attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams </AC2> . <AC3> Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students </AC3> . <AC4> Professors not only have the knowledge , but also equip with experiences , knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements </AC4> .Second , <AC5> it ' s students ' basic responsibility to attend class </AC5> . <AC6> Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves </AC6> . <AC7> Many professors grade their students with class attendances </AC7> . In other words , <AC8> class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances </AC8> . <AC9> Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn ' t show up in the classes </AC9> .Some people might argue that <AC10> if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own </AC10> . Why wasting time going to classes ? Doesn ' t self - study more efficient ? However , in my opinion , <AC11> this is a rather immodest way of thinking </AC11> . I believe that <AC12> professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors </AC12> . Besides , <AC13> even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors , they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates </AC13> .In conclusion , <AC14> students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes </AC14> . <AC15> It ' s an essential learning process </AC15> .

I mean , <AC3> when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success </AC3> .

In this case , I would definitely agree that <AC3> the art and music should be required to study </AC3> .First of all , <AC4> art and music would broaden student ' s horizon and therefore make them thoughtful </AC4> . <AC5> It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border , and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures </AC5> .

The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid - changing world . <AC3> In the past , focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems </AC3> because <AC4> every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage </AC4> .

People who hold different opinion may argue that <AC9> if one can \u2019 t success one \u2019 s own major , what else things he can do in different filed </AC9> .

Meanwhile , eliminating meaningless actions .First of all , <AC3> great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive </AC3> . <AC4> Take myself as an example , I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam , submitting my paper , and finishing my internship work at the end of each term </AC4> . <AC5> Yet , in this year , following the suggestion of my roommate , John , I make a to - do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control </AC5> . <AC6> This plan ability helps me a lot , making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else </AC6> .Equally important , <AC7> the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions , which may ruin one ' s whole effort over a very long time </AC7> . As we all know , <AC8> the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly </AC8> . <AC9> If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead , they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent </AC9> . However , things have been changing all the time . For instance , <AC10> the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company ' s schedule </AC10> . In this case , <AC11> those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired </AC11> . <AC12> Every employee can not afford this kind of loss </AC12> .Finally , some assert that <AC13> the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job </AC13> . Thus , <AC14> it is not need for young people to possess this ability </AC14> . Nevertheless , <AC15> this ability is also essential for young people </AC15> since <AC16> young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability </AC16> . <AC17> As searching information on the internet , young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs </AC17> . At this circumstances , <AC18> they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where </AC18> . <AC19> It is obviously a huge waste of time </AC19> . But <AC20> if they make their plan in the first place , and then stick to their plans , they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination </AC20> .<AC21> In this complex society , we , young people , are encompassed with multiple tasks </AC21> , so <AC22> the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with </AC22> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

On the contrary to this popular belief , there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money .

Also , <AC3> they can help each other for learning materials better </AC3> . However , <AC4> if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems </AC4> .Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that <AC5> by the help of teachers , students can understand ideas faster and easier </AC5> since <AC6> teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points </AC6> . <AC7> In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self - study </AC7> .Finally yet importantly , <AC8> appearing in class makes students more conscientious </AC8> since <AC9> they have to obey class \u2019 s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments </AC9> . However , <AC10> the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times </AC10> . Through this way , <AC11> they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study </AC11> .On the basis of the points mentioned above , I convinced that <AC12> communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials </AC12> . Moreover , <AC13> teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it </AC13> .

In my view , <AC1> it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student </AC1> and this is for two reasons .The main reason is that <AC2> students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job </AC2> . <AC3> Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words </AC3> . For example , <AC4> when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year </AC4> . <AC5> As i had to spend some of my time in my job </AC5> , therefore , <AC6> i had to manage my time efficiently </AC6> . <AC7> I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework </AC7> . <AC8> This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively </AC8> .

As example <AC5> I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe </AC5> . Some of them had no own savings . <AC6> They could not afford the rent </AC6> , so <AC7> they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence </AC7> .In addition , <AC8> you can not be sure about the development in your personal life </AC8> . <AC9> It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings </AC9> . <AC10> Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car </AC10> . <AC11> He could not afford the maintenance </AC11> so <AC12> he had to sell it </AC12> .Finally , <AC13> with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams </AC13> . <AC14> Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished </AC14> . For instance , <AC15> I made a month - long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend </AC15> . <AC16> Without our savings we could not have pursued our long - time dream </AC16> .Considering all the above mentioned arguments , from my point of view <AC17> there is no other choice than saving money for some time </AC17> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

However , while the majority of people live on the fast lane , others decide to reduce the speed and take their time . To draw an entire picture , we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better . In my opinion , <AC1> it is very important to live life at a slower pace </AC1> , because <AC2> living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages </AC2> .First , <AC3> living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health </AC3> . <AC4> If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off , your body will react to your stressful lifestyle </AC4> . <AC5> Many hardworking people have diseases , like the burn - out syndrome </AC5> , because <AC6> their bodies cannot hold the pace </AC6> .

The reasons to be illustrated are follows .Firstly , <AC2> the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject </AC2> . For example , I love Physics .

This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students . Consequently , direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized . However , the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists .

As such , <AC4> the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever </AC4> . Moreover , <AC5> with the use of the Internet , distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance </AC5> . <AC6> College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries </AC6> . Last but not least , <AC7> the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying </AC7> . <AC8> While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes , Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query </AC8> .In the near future , <AC9> the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training </AC9> , for the enormous benefits that it brings about . <AC10> Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously </AC10> ? <AC11> This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances </AC11> .Critics may argue that <AC12> the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively , for instance internet abuse and black webs </AC12> . However , we should bear in mind that <AC13> these problems are mainly triggered by students ' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself </AC13> . Thus , <AC14> what we are to do is a change in learners ' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study </AC14> .After analyzing both points of view , <AC15> I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process </AC15> . It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages . However , it is not just the matter of help or hindrance , it is the way you use the cyberspace .

Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks , while others seem to prefer the opposite position . After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . I favor the former ; that is , <AC1> I prefer to live in a higher pace condition </AC1> .The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that <AC2> we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks , and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam </AC2> . <AC3> I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam </AC3> because <AC4> I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place ; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test </AC4> .

In contrast , <AC13> it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment </AC13> .Based on the reasons demonstrated above , I believe that <AC14> living in a higher pace is better </AC14> because <AC15> the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite </AC15> .

To illustrate , <AC20> when my computer mysteriously broke down , I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help </AC20> . <AC21> They failed to give me any useful solutions </AC21> . <AC22> To my surprise , one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help </AC22> . <AC23> He was very good with computers , and he managed to fix the problem quickly </AC23> .In conclusion , while <AC24> many people decide to live alone for various reasons </AC24> , <AC25> I prefer to live with a roommate , and I always will </AC25> . This is because <AC26> it offers me many advantages , such as less spending , more socializing , and more help </AC26> .

This is an important factor because <AC7> you also get more space than you would in a dormitory </AC7> .Second , from an economic point of view , people often argue that <AC8> an apartment is more expensive </AC8> .

Most of all , <AC3> the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization , from children to adults </AC3> . <AC4> We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life , and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life </AC4> . <AC5> By making teamwork , the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others </AC5> . <AC6> As university students , it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others </AC6> . <AC7> After graduating from schools , employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits </AC7> . Thus , <AC8> almost of us live in the environment of groups </AC8> .<AC9> By participating in an organization , it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose </AC9> . <AC10> A solid group can be a suited environment , which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons </AC10> .

However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co - worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . Therefore in my view , <AC1> a good co - worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship </AC1> .<AC2> The co - workers should be cooperative with one another </AC2> . <AC3> If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes </AC3> . <AC4> I once had a co - worker who was too family conscious </AC4> . Therefore <AC5> he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not </AC5> . <AC6> Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person </AC6> . However , <AC7> one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor </AC7> . <AC8> When I requested my co - worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse </AC8> . <AC9> From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility </AC9> .

My opinion is based on creating memories with parents , saving money , and taking advice from parents .First of all , one of the most significant upsides is that <AC2> the young adult can have more experience with his parents </AC2> . <AC3> The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age </AC3> . <AC4> When having a job , it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown </AC4> . <AC5> If he lives with his parents for longer time , they have more chances to share the feelings , exercise , and travel together </AC5> . <AC6> All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by </AC6> .

For instance , <AC4> if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth , no matter how far it is , you can keep contact </AC4> . <AC5> We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address </AC5> . <AC6> If the address is wrong , then you will know right away </AC6> .

Some people think that <AC9> the face - to - face conversations make them feel stupid </AC9> . <AC10> Sometimes , their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect </AC10> . For instance , <AC11> I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior , it ' s hard for me to face her and explain what she should do </AC11> .

In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must - learn list of the parents . In my opinion , I agree that <AC1> children should learn music and art in a young age </AC1> because <AC2> they do contribute several merits to them </AC2> .First , <AC3> it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young </AC3> . <AC4> Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art - imagination </AC4> . <AC5> Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules </AC5> . <AC6> They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched </AC6> . <AC7> Children are privileged to have these abilities </AC7> because <AC8> they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances </AC8> . <AC9> Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination </AC9> .Second , <AC10> music and art are life - long cultivation worthy of investing </AC10> . <AC11> They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way </AC11> . <AC12> They are essential to our spiritual life </AC12> .

In my opinion , <AC17> it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like </AC17> . <AC18> If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer , that might be too much </AC18> . <AC19> In a child stage , music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills </AC19> . In this way , <AC20> it will not be such pressure on children </AC20> .In conclusion , <AC21> young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art </AC21> and <AC22> they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage , but in every stage </AC22> . <AC23> Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his / her life </AC23> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that <AC1> there will be a decrease in cars use in the future </AC1> . The following reasons will present my points .First of all , since <AC2> the public transportation has improved </AC2> , <AC3> it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus </AC3> . For example , <AC4> I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars </AC4> . So , <AC5> with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own </AC5> .Second , <AC6> a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world </AC6> . So , <AC7> with the risen of the aware to the environment , people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not </AC7> . For example , <AC8> instead of driving each one ' s car , if we put forty people in a bus , it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city </AC8> .Although , I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years . I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view . People who hold different opinion may argue that <AC9> a personal car uses is in need </AC9> because <AC10> a public transportation can ' t meet every place </AC10> . Of course , <AC11> it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places </AC11> . However , <AC12> no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on , it always have some other ways that you can do , you can ride a bike , or even walk on your feet </AC12> . <AC13> It not only helps you to reduce the car use , but also good to your health </AC13> . In this way , <AC14> this won ' t be a problem at all </AC14> .In conclusion , given the reasons described above , when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared , the best choice is obviously stand on my side , which is that <AC15> the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years </AC15> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . In my opinion , <AC1> the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits </AC1> .First of all , <AC2> advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit </AC2> . <AC3> The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self - control </AC3> . It is sure that <AC4> advertising always makes the products so tempting , regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body </AC4> . However , <AC5> advertising is not the only information source for people </AC5> . <AC6> People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources , like news or magazines </AC6> . <AC7> As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits , they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations </AC7> . <AC8> It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast - food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors </AC8> .Second , <AC9> in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle , some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods </AC9> . In other words , <AC10> advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people </AC10> . <AC11> Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added </AC11> . <AC12> These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good </AC12> .

Therefore , I agree with this notion that <AC1> students should be asked to evaluate their teachers </AC1> .To begin with , <AC2> Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers ' performance </AC2> . For example , <AC3> evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product </AC3> . <AC4> Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information </AC4> .

Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that .

For example , <AC3> a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability </AC3> , so that <AC4> every one can work and live in a peaceful environment </AC4> . <AC5> The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors , such as teachers and police officers </AC5> .

As we know , <AC9> there are impoverished or disabled people in every society , needing help and support from others </AC9> . It is true that <AC10> the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties </AC10> , but <AC11> such financial help is usually far from enough </AC11> . In such case , <AC12> aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial , which are a great complement to government support </AC12> . <AC13> Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force </AC13> . <AC14> There are criminals in every society , and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited </AC14> . So <AC15> it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities , by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department </AC15> .In conclusion , it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government . Other than that , <AC16> they have other critical obligations to take , in order to make our society function in an ordered way </AC16> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

However , others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty . Personally , I think <AC1> it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty </AC1> because of many reasons .Firstly , <AC2> capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture </AC2> . <AC3> Crimes kill someone which is illegal ; nevertheless , the government use law to punish them , which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one </AC3> . As a fact that <AC4> the criminal is repeated second time </AC4> ; also , <AC5> it is regarded as the \" legalized revenge \" to victims ' family </AC5> .

This trend is so deeply engraved in people ' s mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned , even when some participants are facing grievous social problems . It is agreed that <AC1> large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation </AC1> . This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace , and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols .Firstly , <AC2> during times of war , people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event </AC2> . For example , <AC3> when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War , its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers </AC3> . This clearly shows that <AC4> international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back , sooner or later , to a relative peaceful normality </AC4> . Thus , <AC5> world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace </AC5> .Secondly , <AC6> these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country </AC6> . For instance , <AC7> when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa , its citizens filled up the stadiums , cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field </AC7> . <AC8> South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night </AC8> . <AC9> This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team </AC9> . As a result , <AC10> it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events </AC10> .In conclusion , after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries , <AC11> it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society , but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness </AC11> . <AC12> This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future </AC12> .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

In addition , <AC5> it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question , they can easily ask for help to their roommates , classmates , or teachers </AC5> . I think <AC6> living in dormitory is always helpful to students </AC6> .On the other hand , <AC7> living off campus prepares students for the real life </AC7> .

However , as far as I am concerned , I strongly agree with the view that <AC1> this great invention causes many social problems </AC1> .In the first place , <AC2> spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life </AC2> .
