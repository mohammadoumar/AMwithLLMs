In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life . From this point of view , I firmly believe that <AC0, MajorClaim> we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education </AC0, MajorClaim> . </para-intro><para-body> First of all , <AC1, Claim> through cooperation , children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students </AC1, Claim> . <AC2, Premise> What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly , how to get along with others </AC2, Premise> . <AC3, Premise> During the process of cooperation , children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others , how to communicate with others , how to think comprehensively , and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred </AC3, Premise> . <AC4, Premise> All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life </AC4, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> On the other hand , <AC5, Premise> the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory </AC5, Premise> .

However , <AC7, Premise> when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation </AC7, Premise> . The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . <AC8, Premise> Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care </AC8, Premise> .

Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . In my opinion , I strongly agree that <AC0, MajorClaim> alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced </AC0, MajorClaim> . In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . </para-intro><para-body> Firstly , <AC1, Premise> an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution </AC1, Premise> . Since <AC2, Premise> automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air </AC2, Premise> , <AC3, Premise> the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants </AC3, Premise> . Therefore , <AC4, Claim> it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles </AC4, Claim> . </para-body><para-body> Secondly , <AC5, Premise> an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion </AC5, Premise> . <AC6, Premise> Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while </AC6, Premise> . What is worse , <AC7, Premise> traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents </AC7, Premise> . Thus , <AC8, Claim> the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented </AC8, Claim> . </para-body><para-body> In order to solve these problems , <AC9, Claim> alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively </AC9, Claim> . With regard to the former , <AC10, Premise> alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal </AC10, Premise> . For example , <AC11, Premise> rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries </AC11, Premise> . <AC12, Premise> This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee </AC12, Premise> . Since <AC13, Premise> bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses </AC13, Premise> , <AC14, Premise> it is a better form to protect environment than automobile </AC14, Premise> . As for the latter point , <AC15, Premise> the introduction of international laws can be also effective </AC15, Premise> . For instance , <AC16, Premise> there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only </AC16, Premise> . Thus , <AC17, Premise> these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution </AC17, Premise> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In summary , even though <AC18, Claim> some people claim the convenience of automobile </AC18, Claim> , I would state that <AC19, MajorClaim> alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion </AC19, MajorClaim> . </para-conclusion>\n###Here is the list of pairs of related argument components in this paragraph: [(3, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (5, 4), (1, 5), (0, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)]", "output": "{\"relation_types\": [\"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\", \"Support\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food . However , I do think that <AC0, MajorClaim> people are likely to spend less time in cooking food </AC0, MajorClaim> . There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . </para-intro><para-body> The first and foremost reason is that <AC1, Premise> with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time </AC1, Premise> . As a result , <AC2, Premise> people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years </AC2, Premise> . Actually , <AC3, Premise> in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework </AC3, Premise> . <AC4, Premise> And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology </AC4, Premise> . Thus , <AC5, Claim> it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future </AC5, Claim> . </para-body><para-body> Another reason is that <AC6, Claim> most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants </AC6, Claim> because <AC7, Premise> they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves </AC7, Premise> . According to a recent survey , <AC8, Premise> 89 % of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on </AC8, Premise> . Thus , <AC9, Premise> they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal </AC9, Premise> . <AC10, Premise> Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study </AC10, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> Some people may argue that <AC11, Claim> investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family </AC11, Claim> . To some extent , it is true . However , <AC12, Premise> as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality </AC12, Premise> . <AC13, Premise> Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed </AC13, Premise> , thus <AC14, Premise> health and life of eaters is assured </AC14, Premise> . Besides , <AC15, Premise> along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities </AC15, Premise> . Consequently , <AC16, Premise> it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time </AC16, Premise> . </para-body><para-conclusion> To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint .

It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public . However , I strongly believe that <AC0, MajorClaim> it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures </AC0, MajorClaim> . </para-intro><para-body> <AC1, Claim> One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content </AC1, Claim> . <AC2, Premise> They have a serious impact on people in their puberty </AC2, Premise> . For example , <AC3, Premise> an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal , where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off </AC3, Premise> . Another supporting reason is that <AC4, Claim> television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture </AC4, Claim> . <AC5, Premise> A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser </AC5, Premise> . <AC6, Premise> This is actually very environmentally unfriendly </AC6, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens .

Even so , <AC9, Premise> another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest </AC9, Premise> . </para-body><para-conclusion> Both sides of the arguments have its merits . My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety , <AC10, MajorClaim> the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information </AC10, MajorClaim> .

Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate . Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money , while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal . In my view , I agree to that fact that <AC0, MajorClaim> higher school students should be made aware of the money management </AC0, MajorClaim> . </para-intro><para-body> The reason why I think <AC1, Claim> teenage students need to understand the money management basics </AC1, Claim> is , primarily <AC2, Premise> when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation , students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family , during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence </AC2, Premise> . For example , <AC3, Premise> while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month , I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses , during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses </AC3, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> In addition , <AC4, Premise> if financial management is taught at an early age , students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status , students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized </AC4, Premise> . For example , <AC5, Premise> buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background </AC5, Premise> . However , <AC6, Premise> for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour </AC6, Premise> . Hence , <AC7, Claim> having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently </AC7, Claim> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In conclusion , I think <AC8, MajorClaim> students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact </AC8, MajorClaim> .

An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students .

Many countries have suffered from pollution , noisy and casualty for a long time . From my perspective , <AC0, MajorClaim> the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways </AC0, MajorClaim> because of three crucial reasons . </para-intro><para-body> First and foremost , <AC1, Claim> we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents </AC1, Claim> . <AC2, Premise> The buses , cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia </AC2, Premise> . Moreover , <AC3, Premise> the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing </AC3, Premise> . Most importantly , <AC4, Premise> there are many accidents happening on the roads </AC4, Premise> . For example , <AC5, Premise> in my country , buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents </AC5, Premise> . Each year , <AC6, Premise> Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan </AC6, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> Secondly , <AC7, Claim> investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work </AC7, Claim> . <AC8, Premise> Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads </AC8, Premise> . For instance , <AC9, Premise> I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home </AC9, Premise> . <AC10, Premise> It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour </AC10, Premise> . In contrast , <AC11, Premise> if the roads are enlarged , everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions </AC11, Premise> . </para-body><para-body> Last but not least , <AC12, Claim> spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality </AC12, Claim> . <AC13, Premise> All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes </AC13, Premise> . <AC14, Premise> Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried </AC14, Premise> . <AC15, Premise> We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents </AC15, Premise> because <AC16, Premise> a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities </AC16, Premise> . <AC17, Premise> What ' s more , a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier </AC17, Premise> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In a nutshell , <AC18, MajorClaim> the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable </AC18, MajorClaim> .

For its accessible and containing fancy programs , television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background . Children , who are addicted to TV , causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time . As far as I am concerned , I agree with that <AC0, MajorClaim> children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively </AC0, MajorClaim> . </para-intro><para-body> First of all , <AC1, Premise> children generally have weak self - control , and thus they lose their time easily </AC1, Premise> . <AC2, Claim> Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents </AC2, Claim> .

In my point of view , <AC16, Claim> even if you are right , criticism is still helpful </AC16, Claim> because <AC17, Premise> in this case it not only is a fixer , but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work </AC17, Premise> . <AC18, Premise> Taking criticism doesn ' t necessary mean that you have to take it all </AC18, Premise> . <AC19, Premise> You should have your own judgments too </AC19, Premise> ! <AC20, Premise> And it ' s kind of art to make the best use of criticism </AC20, Premise> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In conclusion , <AC21, MajorClaim> criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism </AC21, MajorClaim> .
