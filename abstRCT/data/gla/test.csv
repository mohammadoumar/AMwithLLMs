Approximately 40% of patients with glaucoma are concomitantly prescribed >or=2 different intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications. An effective and well-tolerated fixed combination of agents requiring once-daily instillation may improve patient compliance.
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of the fixed combination latanoprost 0.005% + timolol maleate 0.5% QD with those of latanoprost 0.005% monotherapy QD in patients whose elevated IOP (>or=21 mm Hg) was inadequately controlled by latanoprost.
This 21-day, randomized, double-masked, active-control study was conducted at 49 study sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Venezuela. Adults with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had failed to reach an IOP of <21 mm Hg while receiving latanoprost for at least 28 days were enrolled. After an additional 28 days of latanoprost run-in, patients were randomly assigned to continue latanoprost monotherapy or to switch to the fixed combination for 21 days. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double-masked study medication; the per-protocol (PP) analysis included patients who completed the study without a major protocol violation and who had IOP measurements both at baseline and at day 21. The primary end point was the proportion of patients whose IOP was decreased >or=2 mm Hg from the baseline level on day 21. Proportions of patients demonstrating IOP decreases >or=3, >or=4, or >or=5 mm Hg from the baseline level and of patients reaching an 10P <or=18 mm Hg were evaluated.

Carteolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Used topically to reduce intraocular pressure, it is typically applied twice daily. In an effort to provide a once-daily dosing regimen, carteolol was formulated with 1% alginic acid. Sodium alginate is a natural polymer product with bioadhesive properties providing increased corneal contact time and a better carteolol penetration through the cornea. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting 1% carteolol alginate solution compared to standard 1% carteolol solution.
This was a double-masked, parallel group, multicentre study. Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (n=151) were randomly assigned to receive either 1% carteolol alginate once daily (AM) or standard 1% carteolol solution twice daily for 2 months. The masking was maintained through the use of a placebo in the evening for the alginate group. Entry into the study required unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) between 23 mmHg and 32 mmHg at 9 AM and 11 AM. Patients using ocular hypotensive medication were required to undergo a washout. All patients provided written informed consent. Excluded from the study were patients with angle closure, congenital, secondary glaucoma or advanced glaucoma; any intraocular infection or inflammation, ocular trauma, ocular surgery or laser trabeculoplasty within the previous 3 months; contraindications to the use of beta adrenoceptor antagonists; systemic medications likely to modify IOP prescribed or modified during the previous 3 months; ocular steroid use; contact lens wear; and pregnant and lactating women. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 15 and 60 days, with IOP measurements at 9 AM and 11 AM. At day 15 and day 60, IOP was measured just before instillation of medication (9 AM) and 2 hours after (11 AM). Slit lamp examinations were performed at each follow-up examination, together with measurement of heart rate and blood pressure (10 AM) and ocular tolerance after medication (11 AM). The primary efficacy criterion was the decrease in IOP from baseline at day 60 for each measurement at 9 AM and 11 AM. The study eye was the eye with the higher IOP at day 0 or, if equal, the right eye.
Efficacy-of the 151 patients included in the study, 149 were evaluated (two patients were lost to follow-up after day 0): 74 in the alginate group and 75 in the standard group.

Ocular blood flow dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Whereas the effect of single antiglaucoma substances on ocular blood flow has been addressed in various experiments, evidence for fixed combinations is sparse. In the present study, we set out to compare the effects of latanoprost 0.005%/timolol 0.5% (LT) fixed combination and brimonidine 0.2%/timolol 0.5% (BT) fixed combination on intraocular pressure (IOP) and ocular blood flow.
In the present study, which followed a randomized, double-masked 2-way crossover design, 16 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 2 patients with ocular hypertension were included. The patients underwent a 6-week treatment with LT and a 6-week treatment with BT after a washout for previous antiglaucoma medication. Optic nerve head blood flow (ONHBF) was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry; retrobulbar flow velocities were measured using color Doppler imaging in the ophthalmic artery, the central retinal artery, and the posterior ciliary arteries.

To determine if postoperative topical cyclosporine 0.05% has any beneficial effect following trabeculectomy.
This was an interventional, randomized, prospective, double-masked clinical trial of 44 consecutive patients with uncontrolled glaucoma requiring filtration surgery. Ocular surface disease index questionnaire and comprehensive ocular exam, including Schirmer's tear test 1, were performed. Patients underwent routine trabeculectomy, with or without phacoemulsification. The study group (n = 22) received cyclosporine 0.05%, and the control group (n = 22) received artificial tears. Patients were evaluated at 1 and 6 months post surgery. Outcome measures were intraocular pressure, success rate, bleb appearance, ocular surface disease index, Schirmer's tear test 1 and conjunctival inflammation.

Many physicians recommend either brimonidine or latanoprost as firstline therapy for chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. However, a search of MEDLINE indicates that there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the 2 monotherapies in a clinical setting.
This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine 0.2% twice daily with those of latanoprost 0.005% once daily as monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
In this 3-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, 4-visit study, treatment-naive and previously treated patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and bilateral intraocular pressure (IOP) after washout of between 22 and 34 mm Hg were randomized to receive either brimonidine or latanoprost. Patients who had received previous treatment with either study drug were excluded from the study. The primary outcome measure was response rate, defined as the percentage of patients achieving > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline to month 3. Secondary outcome measures were mean IOP reduction from baseline to month 3 and clinical success, defined as the investigator's recommendation that the patient continue using the assigned study medication.
