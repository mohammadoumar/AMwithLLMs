As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that <AC0, MajorClaim> newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence </AC0, MajorClaim> . Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons . </para-intro><para-body> First of all , <AC1, Premise> to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers </AC1, Premise> . <AC2, Premise> Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime </AC2, Premise> . <AC3, Premise> As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages </AC3, Premise> . Hence , <AC4, Claim> the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information </AC4, Claim> . </para-body><para-body> Another point is that , <AC5, Premise> from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one </AC5, Premise> . It is clear to recognize that <AC6, Premise> the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries </AC6, Premise> . The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? <AC7, Premise> The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so </AC7, Premise> . For this reason , <AC8, Claim> the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time </AC8, Claim> . </para-body><para-body> Last , but not least , <AC9, Premise> when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down </AC9, Premise> . <AC10, Premise> This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today </AC10, Premise> . At this point , <AC11, Claim> newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive </AC11, Claim> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media .
