In order to survive in the competition , companies continue to improve their products and service , and as a result , the whole society prospers . However , when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation , what we are concerned about is not the whole society , but the development of an individual ' s whole life .

However , <AC7> when we consider about the question that how to win the game , we always find that we need the cooperation </AC7> . The greater our goal is , the more competition we need . <AC8> Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance , it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach , and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet , and those who are in charge of the medical care </AC8> . The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team . Therefore <AC9> without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition </AC9> . </para-body><para-conclusion> Consequently , no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that <AC10> a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one ' s success </AC10> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation , while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution . In my opinion , I strongly agree that <AC0> alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced </AC0> . In this essay , several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages . </para-intro><para-body> Firstly , <AC1> an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution </AC1> . Since <AC2> automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air </AC2> , <AC3> the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants </AC3> . Therefore , <AC4> it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles </AC4> . </para-body><para-body> Secondly , <AC5> an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion </AC5> . <AC6> Once we get into the traffic jam , it forces us to waste our time for a while </AC6> . What is worse , <AC7> traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result , it leads to an increase of traffic accidents </AC7> . Thus , <AC8> the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented </AC8> . </para-body><para-body> In order to solve these problems , <AC9> alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively </AC9> . With regard to the former , <AC10> alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal </AC10> . For example , <AC11> rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries </AC11> . <AC12> This system is that at the corner of each district , the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee </AC12> . Since <AC13> bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses </AC13> , <AC14> it is a better form to protect environment than automobile </AC14> . As for the latter point , <AC15> the introduction of international laws can be also effective </AC15> . For instance , <AC16> there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only </AC16> . Thus , <AC17> these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution </AC17> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In summary , even though <AC18> some people claim the convenience of automobile </AC18> , I would state that <AC19> alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion </AC19> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint , and among those reasons are two important ones . </para-intro><para-body> The first and foremost reason is that <AC1> with the development of science and technology , more advanced kitchen facilities , such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers , have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time </AC1> . As a result , <AC2> people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two , even three hours like in the last 10 years </AC2> . Actually , <AC3> in recent years , there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework </AC3> . <AC4> And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology </AC4> . Thus , <AC5> it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future </AC5> . </para-body><para-body> Another reason is that <AC6> most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants </AC6> because <AC7> they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves </AC7> . According to a recent survey , <AC8> 89 % of people have come to think that , since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures , they have to use a lot of time to work hard , to update themselves , to acquire all kinds of skills and so on </AC8> . Thus , <AC9> they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal </AC9> . <AC10> Even they have some spare time , they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study </AC10> . </para-body><para-body> Some people may argue that <AC11> investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family </AC11> . To some extent , it is true . However , <AC12> as a matter of fact , using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality </AC12> . <AC13> Even , with the help of ozone machines , bacterias , mold spores , or pesticide in vegetables , fruits and foods will be killed and removed </AC13> , thus <AC14> health and life of eaters is assured </AC14> . Besides , <AC15> along with the high living standard , requirements of quality products in almost restaurants , nowadays , are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities </AC15> . Consequently , <AC16> it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality , but do not waste a lot of time </AC16> . </para-body><para-conclusion> To sum up , if all those factors are contemplated , it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint . So , from what have been discussed above , I strongly affirm the conclusion that <AC17> people will spend less time in cooking food </AC17> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

With technological advances , children have more access to modern games currently . In such case , the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children ' s developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion . For me , I believe <AC0> parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> It is true that <AC1> modern games may be , to some extent , beneficial for children to foster some skills , such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend </AC1> .

As a result , <AC7> communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more </AC7> . </para-body><para-body> Furthermore , <AC8> it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today </AC8> .

By contrast , <AC10> modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits </AC10> . Therefore , <AC11> there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents , such as violence or pornography , arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival </AC11> . </para-body><para-conclusion> Thus , I would conclude that <AC12> traditional games should be , by no means , ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games </AC12> . <AC13> Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process </AC13> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

I however , agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that <AC0> the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> First and foremost , <AC1> if there is control over artists ' ideas , they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run </AC1> . It is undeniable that <AC2> when they are given the opportunity to express themselves , most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies </AC2> . For example , <AC3> paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times </AC3> . In short , <AC4> without any limitations , there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists </AC4> . </para-body><para-body> Furthermore , <AC5> it is every human ' s right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation </AC5> . <AC6> Today , many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries </AC6> . <AC7> Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country </AC7> . To illustrate this further , <AC8> the famous movie ' 3 Idiots ' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn </AC8> . Thus , <AC9> human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely </AC9> . </para-body><para-body> Looking from another perspective , there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted . <AC10> They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country </AC10> . To cite an example , <AC11> Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace </AC11> . <AC12> In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races , this might end up in some chaos among the society </AC12> . Nonetheless , I believe that <AC13> artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts </AC13> . </para-body><para-conclusion> To conclude , it is now evident that <AC14> there should not be any restrictions on artists ' work </AC14> . <AC15> Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves </AC15> as <AC16> ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations </AC16> . Hence , <AC17> even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects </AC17> , I certainly believe that <AC18> there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas </AC18> and thus , I strongly believe <AC19> there should be no restrictions on them </AC19> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

As far as my opinion is concerned , <AC0> I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power </AC0> . I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages . </para-intro><para-body> First and foremost reason is that <AC1> pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons </AC1> . <AC2> Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons </AC2> . <AC3> If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage </AC3> . </para-body><para-body> Another reason to fortify my opinion is that <AC4> even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity </AC4> .

Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet . They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money .

For example , <AC2> they can surf the The Star Onlines ' work section to find a job that is suitable for them </AC2> . <AC3> With the help of the net , they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job </AC3> . Not only that , <AC4> the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with </AC4> . In short , <AC5> if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone , they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive </AC5> . </para-body><para-body> Nonetheless , looking from another perspective , <AC6> supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers ' money </AC6> . This is because <AC7> the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country </AC7> . To illustrate this further , <AC8> the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living </AC8> . To conclude , <AC9> the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed </AC9> . </para-body><para-body> Furthermore , <AC10> when hand phones are provided for free , many would want to take advantage of this opportunity </AC10> . <AC11> It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone , they make themselves jobless </AC11> . <AC12> Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones </AC12> . In this context , <AC13> the public ' s money is spent worthlessly </AC13> .

This is because <AC2> when a shop is attacked by thieves , the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced </AC2> . To illustrate this further , <AC3> in Malaysia , policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight </AC3> . Not only that , <AC4> as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance , they will less likely steal from the shops </AC4> . Thus , it is clear that <AC5> CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized </AC5> . </para-body><para-body> Furthermore , <AC6> at some offices , employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers </AC6> . At times , <AC7> face - to - face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger </AC7> .

Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion . In my personal point of view , <AC0> the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old </AC0> . I , for one , <AC1> strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age </AC1> due to several reasons that I shall discuss below . </para-intro><para-body> First and foremost , <AC2> if senior workers dominate the working sector , there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates </AC2> . As a result , <AC3> most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for </AC3> . To illustrate this further , <AC4> a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day , he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available </AC4> . On top of that , <AC5> due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option , there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace </AC5> . </para-body><para-body> Apart from that , <AC6> not all elderly workers are physically well </AC6> . <AC7> Beyond that age , a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses </AC7> . To cite an example , <AC8> the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him </AC8> . Consequently , <AC9> they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing </AC9> . Besides , <AC10> the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills , resulting in more loss for the institution </AC10> . Thus , <AC11> it would indeed be better if at an older age , opportunities are given to the younger ones </AC11> . </para-body><para-body> Admittedly , <AC12> the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated </AC12> . <AC13> Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering , medicine , and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation </AC13> . Hence , <AC14> it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge </AC14> . </para-body><para-conclusion> In conclusion , <AC15> it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement </AC15> . There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves .

However , I strongly believe that <AC0> it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> <AC1> One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content </AC1> . <AC2> They have a serious impact on people in their puberty </AC2> .

Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression , while others seem to stand on the opposite position . After deeply pondering over this issue , I also develop my own perspective . I favor the former ; that is , <AC0> I agree that face - to - face communication is better </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that <AC1> communicating in person can be more convincing </AC1> . <AC2> Sometimes , face - to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully , and a fitting example can be found from my uncle </AC2> . <AC3> He once complained a service of a restaurant </AC3> . <AC4> Without exaggeration , he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal -- a fly concealed in it </AC4> . <AC5> Afterward , my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face - to face communication </AC5> . <AC6> If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone , I do not think this problem would be thought important </AC6> . Therefore , <AC7> we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way </AC7> . </para-body><para-body> Apart from the one I have mentioned above , another equally crucible aspect is that <AC8> it is easy to be deceived without face - to face communication </AC8> .

Instead <AC5> if you strive hard to achieve what you want , then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal </AC5> .

Although <AC7> my university is not in the high - ranking list , he gained a reputation by those projects </AC7> . <AC8> The research projects like windows opened to the wider world </AC8> . </para-body><para-body> Secondly , <AC9> professors should fully use the research - friendly environment provided by universities </AC9> . <AC10> It is very common to see state - of - the - art laboratories in the campus </AC10> . Also , <AC11> you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together </AC11> . Consequently , <AC12> there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages </AC12> . <AC13> We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin </AC13> . <AC14> Universities positively contribute the professors ' success </AC14> . </para-body><para-body> Last but not least , <AC15> doing research could also improve the teaching quality </AC15> . <AC16> With the help of research projects , professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom </AC16> . <AC17> They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice </AC17> . <AC18> I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor ' s research project </AC18> . <AC19> By participating in it , I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments </AC19> . <AC20> The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching </AC20> . </para-body><para-conclusion> For those reasons , <AC21> it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research </AC21> . <AC22> While extending the way of their own development , the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society </AC22> . </para-conclusion>", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"MajorClaim\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

In some country , teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study . However , some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study . In my view , <AC0> it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he / she is still a student </AC0> and this is for two reasons . </para-intro><para-body> The main reason is that <AC1> students can learn lots of things from part time job , before starting their real job </AC1> . <AC2> Students can learn about time management , money management and convince people by their words </AC2> . For example , <AC3> when I was in my high school I worked as a sales - man in a shop for a year </AC3> . <AC4> As i had to spend some of my time in my job </AC4> , therefore , <AC5> i had to manage my time efficiently </AC5> . <AC6> I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework </AC6> . <AC7> This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively </AC7> . Moreover , <AC8> I learn money management </AC8> . <AC9> When my boss was out of the shop , i had to manage the accounts section of the shop </AC9> . <AC10> From this i learned , how to manage money correctly </AC10> . <AC11> This experience taught me , doing part time job can help students to learn many things </AC11> . </para-body><para-body> Another reason is that <AC12> from part time jobs students can earn money , which can help their parents </AC12> . For instance , when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor . I taught math to two kids of my neighbor . I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books . <AC13> By tutoring them , i earned some money and bought me books with it </AC13> . Moreover , <AC14> after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents </AC14> .

They will argue , <AC16> it can destruct students from their study </AC16> . However , as <AC17> i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result </AC17> ; therefore , i believe <AC18> part time job will be good for students </AC18> .

In contrast , <AC3> without the availability of the same language , there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations , impeding collaborations between them </AC3> .

However , the relationship you need to maintain with your co - worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you , and in most instances you have to rely on him or her . Therefore in my view , <AC0> a good co - worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation , trustworthiness , and fellowship </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> <AC1> The co - workers should be cooperative with one another </AC1> . <AC2> If they do not cooperate , there will be lots of disputes </AC2> . <AC3> I once had a co - worker who was too family conscious </AC3> . Therefore <AC4> he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not </AC4> . <AC5> Most of the time , I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person </AC5> . However , <AC6> one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor </AC6> . <AC7> When I requested my co - worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early , he turned down my request giving a silly excuse </AC7> . <AC8> From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility </AC8> .

In order to achieve this , they start cultivating their children when they are very young . In addition to basic knowledge like language or science , music and art are usually on the must - learn list of the parents . In my opinion , I agree that <AC0> children should learn music and art in a young age </AC0> because <AC1> they do contribute several merits to them </AC1> . </para-intro><para-body> First , <AC2> it ' s very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young </AC2> . <AC3> Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art - imagination </AC3> . <AC4> Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules </AC4> . <AC5> They are more abstract , requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched </AC5> . <AC6> Children are privileged to have these abilities </AC6> because <AC7> they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances </AC7> . <AC8> Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies , music and art still bring out children ' s joy of flying in imagination </AC8> . </para-body><para-body> Second , <AC9> music and art are life - long cultivation worthy of investing </AC9> . <AC10> They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way </AC10> . <AC11> They are essential to our spiritual life </AC11> .

Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen , the car use will decrease . While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life . Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason . But as far as I am concerned , I agree with the idea , which is that <AC0> there will be a decrease in cars use in the future </AC0> . The following reasons will present my points . </para-intro><para-body> First of all , since <AC1> the public transportation has improved </AC1> , <AC2> it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus </AC2> . For example , <AC3> I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn ' t have enough parking lots for the cars </AC3> .

I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view .

Of course , <AC10> it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places </AC10> .

Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits , while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people ' s judgments . In my opinion , <AC0> the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits </AC0> . </para-intro><para-body> First of all , <AC1> advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit </AC1> . <AC2> The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people ' s concept of wholesome diets and self - control </AC2> .

It is agreed that <AC0> large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes , and help them being proud of their nation </AC0> .

I believe that <AC1> decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients </AC1> .
