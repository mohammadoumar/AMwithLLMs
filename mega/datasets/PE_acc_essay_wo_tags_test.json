As a result of this , print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers . Some people , however , still believe that they can exist for long time ; others disagree , arguing that <AC1> newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence </AC1> . Personally , I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons .First of all , <AC2> to obtain information , using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers </AC2> . <AC3> Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper , nowadays , they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet , everywhere and at anytime </AC3> . <AC4> As can be seen , these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world , making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages </AC4> . Hence , <AC5> the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information </AC5> .Another point is that , <AC6> from the economic aspect , buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one </AC6> . It is clear to recognize that <AC7> the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries </AC7> . The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same , even usually less information than those he can have with the internet ? <AC8> The answer , perhaps , is that hardly would rational people do so </AC8> . For this reason , <AC9> the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply , possibly leading to the close - downs of many in the coming time </AC9> .Last , but not least , <AC10> when taking environment into consideration , people must conceive that the more newspapers are published , the more trees are cut down </AC10> . <AC11> This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today </AC11> . At this point , <AC12> newspapers ' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive </AC12> .In conclusion , it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media . However , this , if occurring , should be seen as a result of the ever - increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"MajorClaim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

As for the two integral components within the system , elementary and advanced education , there ' s no doubt that <AC1> a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both </AC1> .Concerning that <AC2> elementary education , like the base of a architecture , is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today ' s society </AC2> , <AC3> government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it </AC3> .

As far as I am concerned , this proposal is beneficial more to the society .<AC2> Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums </AC2> .

In my opinion , <AC1> smoking should not be permitted , especially in public places like restaurants </AC1> because <AC2> it will make the non - smokers breathe uncomfortably </AC2> .First of all , <AC3> restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals </AC3> . <AC4> Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals </AC4> . <AC5> They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them </AC5> .Secondly , <AC6> restaurants are places that people usually come with their families </AC6> .

From my prospect , I believe that <AC1> they do deserve this high payment </AC1> .First of all , <AC2> a worker ' s salary can properly reflect his / her competence and value on his / her career </AC2> . Therefore , <AC3> those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways </AC3> . <AC4> They are not paid for no reason </AC4> . <AC5> As we are now live in a competent world , we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment </AC5> . <AC6> It ' s all the same in every profession </AC6> .

Because <AC3> most people they contact with are also students </AC3> . However , <AC4> when students do part - time jobs , they can work with many kinds of people , and most of whom are adults </AC4> . So , <AC5> they can teach students many things about adult life </AC5> . <AC6> My friend Lisa , who is doing part - time job now , tells me that it is fabulous to take it </AC6> . <AC7> Through part - time job , she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life </AC7> . For example , <AC8> Lisa thought in adult life , work is the core ; but after she knows these friends , she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work </AC8> . Hence , <AC9> thanks to the information her new friends has provided ; now she is more confidence about her future adult life </AC9> .Second , <AC10> parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life </AC10> .

Therefore , <AC13> we need part - time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be </AC13> . Actually , <AC14> some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part - time jobs , they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly ; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part - time job </AC14> . Therefore , <AC15> the part - time job can make people understand future life better </AC15> .Third , some parents are afraid that <AC16> the part - time job will effect student ' study </AC16> .

It is often said that this view is rather unscientific . However , I am convinced that <AC9> it is vital to follow one ' s own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind </AC9> .To sum up , it is evident for me that <AC10> people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals </AC10> .

As for me , <AC1> I would follow the new customs , if I migrated to another country </AC1> .On one hand , <AC2> it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country , if they follow the new customs </AC2> . <AC3> When people migrate to a new country , they are likely to suffer the culture shock , because of the difference between two cultures </AC3> . <AC4> The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture </AC4> . For example , <AC5> if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer - than - usual , full - length Buddhist sutra in Buddha ' s Birthday in India , he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture </AC5> .

Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important , whereas , others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong . Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn .First , critics of zoology argue that <AC1> keeping animals in captivity is wrong </AC1> because <AC2> animals should be considered non - human persons and they should have the right of having freedom </AC2> . <AC3> This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures </AC3> . That is because , <AC4> many zoos , especially the ones in developing countries , do not provide care and attention which their animals require </AC4> . <AC5> The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment </AC5> . In addition , <AC6> sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe </AC6> .On the other hand , the advocators believe that <AC7> zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology </AC7> . <AC8> Many people , especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals , cute baby - born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world </AC8> . <AC9> Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public </AC9> . Also , <AC10> zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life </AC10> . This is due to the fact that , <AC11> in zoos , animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters </AC11> . Thus <AC12> zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced </AC12> .In conclusion , <AC13> both of the arguments have strong supports </AC13> , but in my own view , <AC14> more good come from zoos than bad </AC14> . However , it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention .", "output": "{\"component_types\": [\"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Premise\", \"Claim\", \"MajorClaim\"]}"}, {"instruction": "### You are an expert in Argument Mining.

I completely agree with the idea that <AC1> governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions </AC1> .The first reason why <AC2> education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system </AC2> . I believe that <AC3> decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients </AC3> . Therefore , <AC4> society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients </AC4> .The second reason why <AC5> governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society </AC5> . In my opinion , <AC6> there is nothing more important than health in a human ' s life and the happiness and welfare come with health </AC6> .

Then , many people did not have money . <AC3> When people did not have money , They had to rob other people </AC3> . <AC4> There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities </AC4> .
